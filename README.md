# Stage 4: Path@Penn Prototype

This repository contains the static HTML/CSS implementation of the opening screen for my prototype.  
Open `index.html` in any browser to view the screen at phone size.

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser.

For the best experience, open the page in **Google Chrome**, press **Command+Option+I** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows) to open Developer Tools, and switch to **Device Toolbar â†’ Dimensions: iPhone XR**.  
This will simulate the intended mobile screen size.
